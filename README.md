## The Problem

I was spending hours every week doing the same thing — jumping between TradingView, Yahoo Finance, Reddit, and news sites trying to figure out which stocks to buy. I'd check RSI on one site, volume on another, read some headlines, then try to piece it all together in my head. By the time I had a plan, the move was already happening without me.

I'm not a professional trader. I don't have a Bloomberg terminal or a finance degree. I just wanted one place where I could see **everything** — scores, signals, AI analysis, news, and a clear answer: *should I buy this or not?*

So I built it.

## What It Does

**Asymmetric** screens 250+ stocks across 14 sectors and scores each one using 8 momentum factors. It tells you which stocks have the best risk/reward setup *right now*, gives you AI-powered analysis on any stock in seconds, and tracks the overall market so you know whether it's a good day to trade at all.

The name comes from the trading concept of **asymmetric risk/reward** — finding setups where you risk $1 to potentially make $3, $5, or more. Every feature in this app is designed to surface those opportunities.

## Features

### 📊 Real-Time Screener
Screen 250+ stocks across Technology, Semiconductors, Financials, Healthcare, Energy, and 9 other sectors. Every stock gets a momentum score from 0 to 100 — sortable, filterable, updated live. No manual research, no spreadsheets, no guesswork.

### 🧠 8-Factor Momentum Scoring

| Factor | Points | What It Catches |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Volume Surge** | /20 | Institutional money flowing in — volume vs 20-day average |
| **Breakout Proximity** | /15 | How close to 52-week highs — breakout candidates |
| **Trend Position** | /15 | Price vs 20 & 50 day moving averages — riding the trend or fighting it |
| **Momentum Acceleration** | /15 | Is momentum speeding up or slowing down? |
| **RSI Sweet Spot** | /10 | RSI 55-65 is the momentum zone — strong but not overbought |
| **Relative Strength** | /10 | Outperforming the S&P 500? Leaders, not laggers |
| **Earnings Catalyst** | /10 | Upcoming earnings within 14 days — potential price movers |
| **IV Percentile** | /5 | Options market pricing in a big move |

A stock scoring **75+** gets a **STRONG BUY** signal. **60+** is a **BUY**. Below 40 is a **SELL**. Simple.

### 🤖 AI Stock Analyst
Click any stock and ask the AI anything — *"Should I buy NVDA?"*, *"Give me a trade plan for AMD"*, *"What are the 3 biggest risks?"*. The AI doesn't just give you a generic answer. It sees the live price, the score breakdown, recent news, fundamentals, and current market conditions. It gives you specific entry prices, targets, stop-losses, and position sizes.

Powered by Llama 3.3 70B through Groq — fast, free, and surprisingly good.

### 🎯 AI-Powered Picks
Not sure where to start? The Picks page runs AI analysis across your top-scored stocks and gives you:
- A **Top Pick** with full trade setup (entry, target, stop, size)
- **Urgent alerts** for stocks hitting extreme levels
- **Buy/sell/switch recommendations** with reasoning
- **Portfolio health check** if you have positions

### 📈 Market Intelligence
Before you trade, understand the market:
- Live indices — S&P 500, NASDAQ, DOW, VIX, Russell 2000
- Market breadth — are most stocks going up or down today?
- Sector heat map — which sectors are leading and which are getting crushed
- AI market briefing — one-click analysis of overall conditions, risks, and opportunities
- Latest news feed with real-time headlines

### 📓 Trade Journal
Log your trades, track your win rate, and learn from your mistakes. Every trade you take gets recorded with entry/exit prices, reasoning, and outcome.

### 📐 Kelly Calculator
Don't blow up your account. The Kelly Criterion tells you exactly how much to put in each trade based on your win rate and risk/reward ratio. Choose conservative (quarter Kelly), moderate (half), or aggressive (full) sizing.

### 👁️ Watchlist
Track stocks you're watching but haven't pulled the trigger on yet.

### 💼 Portfolio Tracker
See your open positions, current P&L, and overall portfolio health in one view.
